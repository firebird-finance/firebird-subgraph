# Firebird Subgraph

The graphql schema is still under heavy development and will likely have major breaking changes.

Only the factory address is needed in subgraph.yaml, new pool addresses are automatically picked up using Graph Protocol's data source templates.


## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Global Yarn Packages
    - ganache-cli
    - truffle
    - graph-cli
- Docker

### Services

Start a ganache chain using 0.0.0.0 as a host so docker can connect

```
ganache-cli -h 0.0.0.0 -d -l 4294967295 --allowUnlimitedContractSize
```

Run a local graph node

```
git clone https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/
```

Update ethereum value in docker-compose.yml to `ganache:http://host.docker.internal:8545`

```
cd graph-node/docker
```

```
docker-compose up
```

To blow away graph-node settings

```
docker-compose kill && docker-compose rm -f && rm -rf data
```

### Contracts

Deploy balancer contracts using truffle. Using the `yarn deploy` script in balancer-dapp also makes this easy to test out the subgraph using the frontend.

### Subgraph

Clone the balancer subgraph

```
git clone git@github.com:balancer-labs/balancer-subgraph.git
```

Update factory address in subgraph.yaml to the one listed as part of the deploy

Install dependencies

```
yarn
```

Generate the graph code

```
yarn codegen
```

Create local node

```
yarn create:local
```

Deploy locally

```
yarn deploy:local
```

Any updates can be made to this repo and re-running `yarn deploy:local` without needing to re-initialize the environment.

## Running Locally With Parity Kovan Node

Start Parity:

```
parity --chain=kovan --jsonrpc-interface=0.0.0.0
```

Update ethereum value in docker-compose.yml to `kovan:http://host.docker.internal:8545`

Comment out try_ functions in pool.ts LN52-64

```
cd graph-node/docker
```

```
docker-compose up
```

Create local node

```
yarn create:local
```

Deploy locally

```
yarn deploy:local
```

To blow away graph-node settings

```
docker-compose kill && docker-compose rm -f && rm -rf data
```

**List of pools**
```GraphQL

    totalShares

      }
      userAddress {

```

**Pools with 2 tokens**
```GraphQL
{
  pools (where: {tokensList_contains: ["0x5b1869d9a4c187f2eaa108f3062412ecf0526b24", "0xcfeb869f69431e42cdb54a4f4f105c19c080a601"]}) {

  }
}
